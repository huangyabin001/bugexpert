     * Explanation:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>level 1 means that this message can be shown only once per runtime.
     * In other words this shows which main step of the processing is being executed.</li>
     * <li>level 2 can be shown once per plugin and there can be only one of these
     * when executing a certain step of the plugin. In other words these are intended
     * to show which plugin is executing right now.</li>
     * <li>level 3 can be shown once per plugin run. These are intended to show which step
     * of the plugin is being executed.</li>
     * <li>level 4 can be shown several times per plugin run. For example if the plugin
     * processes log files, these can be parsing errors, since several lines in the log
     * can have wrong format.</li>
     * <li>level 5 is used as a generic low-prio message</li>
     *
     * @param level The detail level of the message
     * @param type The output stream of the message
     * @param msg The message body
